   <h3> How to get started <h3></h3>
    <br>You will make an initial deposit of ₦50,000 or more and select your desired goods up to that amount. After your first purchase, you'll enjoy wholesale prices on future transactions without needing to meet the ₦50,000 minimum. <br>

    <h1 style="font-size: large;text-align: center;" >Payment and Order Policy</h1>

    <br>
    
    At Yarima’s Collections, products are not reserved or held, until payments are made. We validate orders only upon receipt of payment. This ensures that our products are available to all customers on a first-come, first-served basis.
    
    In other words, products are not set aside or guaranteed until payment has been processed. This policy helps us manage inventory effectively and ensure fairness for all customers.
    
    
    Thank You.
