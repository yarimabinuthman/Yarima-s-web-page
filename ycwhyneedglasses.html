    <h3>WHY DO YOU NEED GLASSES</h3>
<p>When thinking about sun protection, we often focus on our skin, but our eyes are equally vulnerable to the sun's damaging effects. Sunglasses are not just a stylish accessory; they play a crucial role in safeguarding our eye health.

<h5>The Risks of UV Exposure</h5>
Prolonged exposure to the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays can cause serious damage to our eyes. Inadequate UV protection can affect the cornea and internal structure of the eye, leading to various eye problems.

<h5>Effects of UV Exposure on the Eyes</h5>
Some of the potential risks include:
<ul>
<li>- Cataracts: A clouding of the eye's lens that can cause blurry vision and, if left untreated, lead to blindness.</li>
<li>- Macular degeneration: Damage to the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision, which can lead to vision loss.</li>
<li>- Photokeratitis: A painful condition caused by UV exposure, often referred to as "sunburned eyes."</li>
<li>- Eye cancers: Some studies suggest a link between prolonged UV exposure and an increased risk of eye cancers. </li></ul>

<h5>Choose Sunglasses with Adequate UV Protection</h5>
When selecting sunglasses, look for lenses with sufficient UV filters to protect your eyes. Ensure the sunglasses block 99-100% of UVA and UVB rays.

<h5> Prioritize Eye Health </h5>
By wearing sunglasses with proper UV protection, you can enjoy the sun while safeguarding your eye health. Don't underestimate the importance of UV protection â€“ it's a simple step that can make a significant difference in preserving your vision.</p>
